# [Re]Release

## Introduction
It's a problem that I'd had many a time before... I want to watch a movie, maybe I have a vague sense that I want it to be a comedy, or something from the early 2000s, 
and so I do a quick Google search to find films that fill that brief and BAMM! A million movies come at me, now saddling me with an entirely different dilemma than the
one I had originally set out to solve.

Choice paralysis may be something that we're starting to really dive into as a soceital concept, but there aren't a lot of applications currently out there that try to directly
solve that problem. Companies like Google and Netflix want increased traffic, meaning that the more time you spend scrolling through options, the better it is for their stats.
But this can leave users feeling burnt out, even over a choice that is supposed to be fun and unstressful like picking out a movie.

Not to sound too much like an infomercial, but I started to ask if there was a better way to go about answering this age old question of "What do you want to watch?". Could I design an
app that would expose people to interesting, maybe even unheard of films the same way that fancy algorithms can while not piling on choice after choice that can make the process
overly-laborious? I wanted an app that I would use myself, something simple that I could type my preferences into, find a movie, and get on with my day with as little pain as possible.

## Development
Since I was envisioning an app with myself in mind as the ideal consumer, there were a few important things that I knew I had to take into account:

1. Avoid repetition
2. Ensure that recommendations contain just the right amount of information
3. Maintain a connection to the past
4. Encourage engagement with obscure or unheard of films
5. Embrace 'hate-watching'
